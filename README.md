angular-gauge
----------------------

Current Version: `0.1.0`

`angular-gauge` is a reusable gauge directive for Angular 1.x apps and dashboards. It provides many configuration options to customize according to your needs.

This directive project is currently in development stage. So you can only install it in development only right now. I do not recommend to use it for production use.
